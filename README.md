# Blazer
## What is Blazer
Blazer is a project that is meant to act as a guide for those impacted by fires. It has features such as a fire map, checklist, chatbot, additional language support, and a newsfeed.
The goal is to have an application that users can use to  find out all the information they want easily and quickly, saving them precious time in these moments to focus on larger issues.

## Blazer Status
Currently, Blazer is still in development, but a demo can be found below.
